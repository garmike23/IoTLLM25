# SLM-For-Edge-Devices
This project explores the use of Small Language Models (SLMs)
for enhancing autonomous decision-making capabilities in self-driving cars powered by
resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi. Students will evaluate and deploy
TinyLMs that can efficiently perform inference on local edge hardware to support critical
driving decisions.
