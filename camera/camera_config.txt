For this project, we want to utilize the camera onboard the Raspberry Pi to grab real-time video
feeds to perform inference.The onboard MIPI CSI connector on the Raspberry Pi allows to connect 
on official Raspberry Pi camera modules. 

-Execute the following command after connecting to the Raspberry Pi. This shows the live camera 
feed for about 5 seconds 
  rpicam-hello

-Perform inference with the Raspberry Pi Camera utilziing the yolov11n model
  python3 camera_config.py
